# Commit Organization Example

This document demonstrates how the changes in this PR were organized into atomic commits following the conventional commit format.

## Commit History

The following commits were created to demonstrate proper atomic commit organization:

### 1. docs: add contribution guidelines and commit conventions (38bacc5)

**Type:** `docs` - Documentation changes

**Changes:**
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with comprehensive guidelines for:
  - Conventional commit format specifications
  - Atomic commit principles
  - Examples of good vs. bad commits
  - Development workflow
- Added .gitmessage template for commit messages
- Updated README.md Contributing section with reference to CONTRIBUTING.md

**Why atomic:** This commit only adds documentation and guidelines. It doesn't change any source code and can be independently reviewed and merged.

**Buildable:** ✅ Yes - Documentation changes don't affect build
**Testable:** ✅ Yes - No code changes, tests still pass

---

### 2. chore: add GitHub templates and git configuration (4904844)

**Type:** `chore` - Tooling and configuration changes

**Changes:**
- Added .gitattributes for consistent line endings across platforms
- Added GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- Added pull request template with conventional commit checklist

**Why atomic:** This commit only affects project tooling and GitHub configuration. It's a separate concern from documentation and doesn't modify application code.

**Buildable:** ✅ Yes - Configuration changes don't affect build
**Testable:** ✅ Yes - No code changes, tests still pass

---

### 3. docs: add XML documentation to TasksController (c3d890c)

**Type:** `docs` - Documentation changes

**Changes:**
- Added XML documentation comments to TasksController class
- Added XML documentation to all public methods
- Enabled XML documentation generation in TaskOrchestrator.API.csproj
- Added response code documentation for Swagger/OpenAPI

**Why atomic:** This commit only adds code documentation. It doesn't change functionality, just improves API documentation for developers and Swagger UI.

**Buildable:** ✅ Yes - Builds successfully with documentation
**Testable:** ✅ Yes - No functional changes, all tests pass

---

### 4. feat: add data validation attributes to DTOs (5b12985)

**Type:** `feat` - New feature

**Changes:**
- Added DataAnnotations validation attributes to CreateTaskDto
- Added DataAnnotations validation attributes to UpdateTaskDto
- Added DataAnnotations validation attributes to CreateUserDto
- Added DataAnnotations validation attributes to CreateProjectDto
- Includes Required, StringLength, and EmailAddress validators

**Why atomic:** This commit adds a new feature (data validation) to the application. It's a single, focused change that adds validation capabilities across all DTOs.

**Buildable:** ✅ Yes - Builds successfully with new validation
**Testable:** ✅ Yes - All existing tests pass (new validation doesn't break existing functionality)

---

## Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Each commit has a single purpose
- Documentation commits only change docs
- Chore commits only change tooling/config
- Feature commits only add new features

### 2. Each commit is independently buildable
Every commit in this PR can be checked out and built successfully:
```bash
git checkout 38bacc5 && dotnet build  # ✅ Succeeds
git checkout 4904844 && dotnet build  # ✅ Succeeds
git checkout c3d890c && dotnet build  # ✅ Succeeds
git checkout 5b12985 && dotnet build  # ✅ Succeeds
```

### 3. Each commit is independently testable
All tests pass at every commit:
```bash
git checkout <any-commit> && dotnet test  # ✅ All tests pass
```

### 4. Conventional commit format is followed
Every commit message follows the pattern:
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

Where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`

### 5. Commits are authored consistently
All commits (except the initial plan) are authored by Brandon-Anubis:
```
git log --format="%an <%ae>"
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Easy code review:** Each commit can be reviewed independently
2. **Clear history:** The purpose of each change is immediately clear
3. **Safe rollback:** Any commit can be reverted without affecting others
4. **Semantic versioning:** Commit types (feat, fix, etc.) can drive automatic version bumping
5. **Changelog generation:** Conventional commits can automatically generate changelogs
6. **Debugging:** Git bisect is more effective with atomic commits
7. **Cherry-picking:** Individual features/fixes can be cherry-picked to other branches

## How to Apply This to Your Work

1. **Plan your work:** Before coding, think about logical groupings of changes
2. **Work in small increments:** Make one logical change at a time
3. **Test frequently:** Ensure each commit builds and passes tests
4. **Write clear messages:** Follow conventional commit format
5. **Review before pushing:** Use `git log` to review your commits
6. **Squash if needed:** If you made messy commits during development, squash and organize them before pushing

## Tools to Help

- **Git commit template:** Use `.gitmessage` template (set with `git config commit.template .gitmessage`)
- **Commitizen:** Tool for guided conventional commits
- **Conventional Commits VSCode extension:** Helps write proper commit messages
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Enforce commit message format
